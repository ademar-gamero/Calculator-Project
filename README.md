# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 7

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

What is this homework assignment about?
**This homework assignment is about creating a function calculuator using a stack and a dynamic array for our data structure**

### Gather

What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new?
**I know how a dynamic array works, I need to learn more about stacks though**

### Brainstorm

What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment?
**Some ideas I have is creating two seperate stacks one to deal with integers inputed by the user and the other to deal with the operands inputed**

What are existing strengths I can bring to bear to solve the problems?
**my debugging skills, understanding of dynamic arrays**

What are some new skills I will need to develop?
**understanding of stacks**
### Evaluate

What is the best way forward that I can see now?
**The best way forward is to pass the locked tests, then remove all the compilation errors, then do activity 7 to gain a better understanding of stacks, then work on invariant**

### Plan

What will I work on first after I finish this planning part?
**Remove all compilation errors, already passed the locked tests**

*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review

Did I correctly anticipate the difficulties?

How did the plan go?
